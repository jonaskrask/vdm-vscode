This example shows the discrete event model used for
co-simulation of the ChessWay personal people mover
as used in the DESTECS project (see http://www.destecs.org).
It reflects the status of the model which is mentioned
in the paper <I>A Formal Approach to Collaborative Modelling
and Co-simulation for Embedded Systems</I> which is submitted
to the Journal Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.
The corresponding continuous time model is available
through the first author.
