This is a Specification of the File System Layer, sliced at the 
FS_DeleteFileDir operation, as defined in the INTEL Flash File 
System document. It includes: a VDM++ model that can be model 
checked in an equivalent Alloy model; and an adapted version 
of the VDM++ model to be used in the Overture Automated Proof 
Support system. In the test class UseFileSystemLayerAlg there 
are a few examples of using the traces primitives used for 
test automation. This model has been developed by Miguel 
Ferreira
